# 🎓 Will They Get the Job?  
**Tackling Imbalanced Data with Ensemble and Skew Kernel Methods**

This project presents my solution to a classification problem that involves predicting whether a student will be placed in a job based on their academic and demographic profile. The dataset is highly **imbalanced** (roughly a 5:1 ratio of unplaced to placed students), which required creative modeling approaches beyond standard classifiers.

## 🧠 Approaches Explored

### 1. Hybrid Ensemble Model (KNN + XGBoost → MLP)
- Base models: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **XGBoost**
- Their predictions are used as features for a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **Bayesian Optimization** is used for tuning hyperparameters efficiently

### 2. Support Vector Machine with Skew-Normal Kernel
A custom kernel was developed using the **skew-normal distribution** to improve SVM performance on asymmetric, imbalanced data.

The **Skew-Normal kernel** is defined as:

K(x, x') = exp( - ||x - x'||² / (2σ²) ) * Φ( α * ||x - x'|| / σ )


Where:
- `Φ` is the CDF of the standard normal distribution
- `σ` is the smoothing parameter
- `α` is the skewness parameter

This kernel introduces asymmetry into the similarity function, allowing the SVM to better model **minority class boundaries**.
